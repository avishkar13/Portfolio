              <p> <b>Hello!</b> I’m Avishkar Deogharia, a passionate web developer and coding enthusiast currently pursuing my second year of BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. With a growing set of skills in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy creating interactive and efficient web applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
              <p>On the frontend, I’m skilled in <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and <b>JavaScript,</b> with proficiency in <b>Tailwind CSS</b> for building responsive, clean, and visually appealing UIs. I've recently started developing with <b>React,</b> a powerful library that enables me to make dynamic user interfaces, and I've used Vite to streamline the React setup, enhancing both speed and efficiency in my projects. For styling and layout management, <b>Tailwind CSS</b> adds a unique, streamlined approach that keeps my designs consistent and efficient across screens.</p>
              <p>In backend development, I work with <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express,</b> which allow me to build server-side logic and RESTful APIs. I’m also exploring <b>Next.js</b> for full-stack applications, enabling faster, server-rendered pages. For database management, I use <b>MongoDB</b> alongside <b>Mongoose</b> for a flexible, schema-based approach to storing and handling data. Additionally, I’m familiar with <b>localStorage</b> for client-side data persistence, especially helpful in applications like my password management tool.</p>
              <p>I’m excited to continue honing my skills and exploring new technologies as I work towards a career in full-stack development. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting and sharing my journey with you!</p>
